# nvim_config
nvim config using coc-vim

this is the personal configuration,
and you can take it as a base to change to your favourite.


# usage
(1) set environment variable $XDG_CONFIG_HOME

you can set env variable in your .bashrc or .zshrc like me.

```
export XDG_CONFIG_HOME=/Users/lishulong/.config
```

this step can not be omitted since in rc files, I use this variable.


(2) git clone codes to your $XDG_CONFIG_HOME
```
 lishulong@lishulongs-MacBook-Pro  ~/.config/nvim   master 
 ☛  ls
 autoload  coc-settings.json  colors  init.vim  vimrcs

```


(3) run nvim and do :PlugInstall

(4) change configuration as you wish

it is just simple.
